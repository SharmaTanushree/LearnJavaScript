## Iterables and Array Like Object

- Iterables
  
> Iterables are objects that implement iterator protocal and have symbol.iterator method.
> We can say an object is iterable if we can implement for-of loop on it.
> example : string, nodeList, Map, set

- Array-like object

> Objects that has length property and use index to access the items are Array-like object.
> example : string, nodelist.
>
> Array is different from Array-like object. it has some special methods and properties.
